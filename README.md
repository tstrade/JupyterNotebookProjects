# JupyterNotebookProjects
This repository contains short projects / reports in JupyterNotebook that demonstrate skills in Python, LaTeX, NumPy, Pandas, RegEx, and MatPlotlib,
and demostrates the ability to effectively communicate field-specific knowledge to a larger audience. 

The files can be generally described as follows:
- Address Book: Coding project that takes data from the UB Directory and uses RegEx to return a reformatted directory of Names, Office location, Email, and Phone number

- Epidemic: Coding project based off of Conway's "Game of Life" that explores how various starting states and available identities (sick, healthy, recovered, vaccinated)
            affect the progression of a simulated epidemic

- Pythagorean Triples: Report that explores methods of finding Pythagorean Triples (whole number side lengths of a right triangle)

- The Mayfly Model: Report that explores population growth and depicts the cyclic demands of natural abundance/scarcity
